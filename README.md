The Makefile in this repository allows generation of a basic Debian
installation for the [USB armory](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory).

Pre-compiled releases are [available](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory-debian-base_image/releases).

# Prerequisites

A Debian 8 installation with the following packages:

```
bc binfmt-support bzip2 gcc gcc-arm-none-eabi git gnupg make parted qemu-user-static wget xz-utils zip
```

Import the Linux signing GPG key:
```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 38DBBDC86092693E
```

Import the U-Boot signing GPG key:
```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 87F9F635D31D7652
```

# Building

Launch the following command to download and build the image:

```
make all
```

The following output files are produced:
```
usbarmory-debian_jessie-base_image-YYYYMMDD.raw
usbarmory-debian_jessie-base_image-YYYYMMDD.raw.xz
usbarmory-debian_jessie-base_image-YYYYMMDD.raw.zip
```

# Installing

**IMPORTANT**: `/dev/sdX`, `/dev/diskN` must be replaced with your microSD
device (not eventual microSD partitions), ensure that you are specifying the
correct one. Errors in target specification will result in disk corruption.

Linux (verify target from terminal using `dmesg`):
```
sudo dd if=usbarmory-debian_jessie-base_image-YYYYMMDD.raw of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
```

Mac OS X (verify target from terminal with `diskutil list`):
```
sudo dd if=usbarmory-debian_jessie-base_image-YYYYMMDD.raw of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
```

On Windows, and other OSes, alternatively the [Etcher](https://etcher.io)
utility can be used.

# Connecting

After being booted, the image uses Ethernet over USB emulation (CDC Ethernet)
to communicate with the host, with assigned IP address 10.0.0.1 (using 10.0.0.2
as gateway). Connection can be accomplished via SSH to 10.0.0.1, with default
user `usbarmory` and password `usbarmory`. NOTE: There is a DHCP server running
by default. Alternatively the host interface IP address can be statically set
to 10.0.0.2/24.

# LED feedback

To aid initial testing the base image configures the board LED to reflect CPU
load average, via the Linux Heartbeat Trigger driver. In case this is
undesired, the heartbeat can be disabled by removing the `ledtrig_heartbeat`
module in `/etc/modules`. More information about LED control
[here](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/GPIOs#led-control).

# Resizing

The default image is 4GB of size, to use the full microSD space a new partition
can be added or the existing one can be resized as described in the USB armory
[FAQ](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-(FAQ)).
